        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Everett Whitney and I specialize in front-end web development but do have experience in backend development!
            In my free time, I am a musician that plays the electric guitar. With this, I also provide lessons!

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Website Creation</h3>
            <p>Collaborated together on the construction of a fully working website called Santsec Cybersecurity! From scratch, I developed 80% of how the website looks and interacts with the end-user.
                Through this employment, I had to quickly learn how to use CSS, HTML and/or HBS, JavaScript, and a little bit of Python. I also had to learn how to effectively use Git and Github procedures. 
            </p>

            <h3>In Progress: Beginner Guitarist Web App</h3>
            <p>I am currently developing a web application designed to help beginner guitarists understand chord theory. The app allows users to select a scale root and see related chords, identify chord formulas, and may include visual chord diagrams and sound playback in future iterations. It is being built with React and JavaScript to ensure an interactive and responsive user experience.</p>

            <h3>Veteran of the United States Marine Corps</h3>
            <p>I served from September 9, 2019 - September 8, 2023. During that time I worked as an Administrative Specialist.
                I took care of my fellow service members pay, orders, quality assurance, filing, etc.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I attend the University of New Orleans pursing a Computer Science Degree.
                I have the majority of my backend development here based upon my homeworks/labs with a primary focus in JAVA. Through these courses, I made my own tamagotchi pet, a maze game, and a snake game.
                As of April 25, 2025, I am currently going to be a Junior or  3rd Year heading into the Fall of 2025. I have succesfully completed one of the hardest classes in the Computer Science program, Data Structures and Algorithms.
